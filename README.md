# Unexpected Keyboard (Floating Fork)

*(this fork was entirely undertaken by Claude Code as part of my testing of CC - after a few false starts, humblingly, all works well enough for me to daily-drive)*

Personal fork of Unexpected Keyboard with additional features:

- **Directory-based layout loading**: Load XML keyboard layouts from any directory on your device storage
  - Pairs with a [Nix module](https://github.com/harryaskham/collective-public/blob/main/modules/agnostic/unexpected-keyboard/default.nix) for generating XML layouts.
- **Floating keyboard mode**: Detach keyboard from bottom of screen as a draggable floating window  
- **Nord colorscheme**: Arctic-inspired dark theme with blue accents

# Unexpected Keyboard (FORKED)

Personal fork of Unexpected Keyboard with additional features:

- **Directory-based layout loading**: Load XML keyboard layouts from any directory on your device storage
  - Pairs with a [Nix module](https://github.com/harryaskham/collective-public/blob/main/modules/agnostic/unexpected-keyboard/default.nix) for generating XML layouts.
- **Floating keyboard mode**: Detach keyboard from bottom of screen as a draggable floating window  
- **Nord colorscheme**: Arctic-inspired dark theme with blue accents
